# Apollo Server Tutorial

This repo contains the code from the `server` directory that was built in the first sections of the [Apollo Tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction/).

This branch uses [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) as an ORM to access the [SQLite database](./store.sqlite). Navigate to the [`main`](https://github.com/nikolasburk/apollo-server-tutorial) branch for a version of this Apollo Server that uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/apollo) as an ORM.
